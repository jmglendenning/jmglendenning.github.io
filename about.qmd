I am a Master's student at the University of Texas at Dallas studying GIS.

I am interested in applying GIS tools and techniques to historical questions.  Projects that I have worked on include:

  * Roman villa site location analysis and predictive modeling
  * A Python implementation of Geomorphons
  * Application of low-cost drones to disaster efforts
  * Python-based DEM-based spatial statistics via WCS data-acquisition
  
I am currently working on analyzing Roman coin hoards.

I have a strong interest in remote sensing and tools.
