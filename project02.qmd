# Project Ideas: Voting, Education, and Health Data Visualization



\textbf{Algebra}


$\textbf{Differentiation}\\$

\textbf{Integration}\\

\textbf{Probabilities}\\
$

In-line
\begin{align*}
P(\text{not } A) &= 1 - P(A) \\
P(A \text{ and } B) &= P(A) \times P(B)
\end{align*}

Side-by-side
\begin{array}{ll}
P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A) & 
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
\end{array}


$\textbf{Statistics}$

\textbf{\underline{Three levels of measurement:}}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Nominal (names)}
  \item \textbf{Ordinal (rank order)}
  \item \textbf{Interval-ratio (scale)}
\end{enumerate}


This is a simple LaTeX document that demonstrates how to write mathematical equations.

Here is an inline equation: $E = mc^2$, which shows the relationship between energy, mass, and the speed of light.

Here is the same equation as a displayed equation:
\[
E = mc^2
\]



## Additions
To make the visualizations **sophisticated, artistic, and attractive**:
- Use **custom color palettes** (viridis, wesanderson, scientific palettes).  
- Explore **non-traditional layouts** (circular, radial, layered).  
- Add **interactive storytelling**: clicking on a region brings up linked health/education/voting histories.
