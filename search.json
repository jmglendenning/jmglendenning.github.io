It is like a LinkedIn feed dressed in consultant gray. Each entry gestures toward insight, but full meaning is buried behind paywalled reports or vague executive summaries whose methodology is extremely suspect.\n2024: The Year in Charts, on the other hand, is a retrospective with animated charts wrapped neatly into themes like AI, talent, resilience, and equity. The visuals are clean and varied such as Voronoi diagrams, treemaps, proportional circles, etc., and each chart is wrapped in polished prose that gently nudges a C-suite audience toward McKinsey’s consulting services. Every chart says: Here’s a big problem. You’ll probably need help with it.\nBoth are visually appealing, professionally produced, and focused more on narrative polish than exploratory depth.\n\nWhat can be better innovated?\n\nThe Year in Charts includes great storytelling with accessibility including screen reader descriptions), but the visuals themselves are static GIFs, bog standard and not interactive. There’s no data download, no tooltips, no filtering, and absolutely no what-if sliders. It is purely presentation over exploration.\nIf they want to elevate the work beyond sales collateral:\n•   Interactivity: Replace GIFs with dynamic dashboards. Let users filter by industry or region, scrub timelines, or export views.\n•   Transparency: Link to source data, show methodologies, and make assumptions visible, if this is truly about insight, not only influence.\n•   Comparative Tools: Let users benchmark or compare across sectors rather than passively consume the gently curated visuals.\n•   Live Updates: Include real-time metrics or trend alerts so content is fresh, unlike the 2023 forecast of Metaverse growth.\nFinal Word\nThese charts as a group are presenting data and more about signaling thought leadership to corporate decision-makers. Sleek, safe, and softly persuasive. McKinsey doesn’t want you playing with the data. They want you calling them to solve it.\n\n\n3 Data Visualization Guides\nReview these university libraries’ data visualization guides:\n\nDuke University Library\n\n\nCompleted\n\n\nUniversity of California Berkeley\n\n\nCompleted\n\nWhat are the Four Pillars of Visualization?\n\n\nPurpose - why\nContent - what\nStructure - how\nFormatting - everything else\n\n\n\n\n4 Notes\nCertain elements of this preparation were enhanced with an LLM including but not limited to code restructuring, commenting, and information layout."

    "text": "2.1 Inge Druckrey\nTeaching to see by Andrei Severny and Edward Tufte (~ 37 minutes)\n\nCompleted\n\n\n2.1.1 Write a one-page review:\n\nLearn thin/thick and curve/linearity from Druckrey\nHow did Holmes describe and contrast the eye and the hand in writing?\nWhy calligraphy is important to Steve Jobs and the design of Mac computers?\nDifferentiate geometric accuracy and optical accuracy\n\nReview: Teaching to See – Lessons from Inge Druckrey and Beyond\nIn the documentary Teaching to See, we learned about Inge Druckrey, a design teacher who changed how students look at the world around them. Her teaching method was strict but eye-opening. One of her biggest lessons was about understanding contrasts, the use of negative and positive. Contrasts between thin and thick lines, between curved and straight shapes, and different textures were prominent in her teaching. When students practiced brush lettering and Roman capital letters, they learned how these visual elements work together to create rhythm and balance. Making an ‘R’ or a ‘S’ wasn’t just about making something pretty or functional, it was about mastering the basic contrasts that make letters work and communicate clearly. She pushed students to make small improvements to enhance their work. Make a curve deeper. Adjust a line thickness. She taught them to see the shape, not merely copy it.\nOne student, Holmes, shared an interesting idea about the eye versus the hand in writing. The eye is conservative and wants everything to look neat, orderly, and easy to read. However, the hand is radical, and wants to write fast and show personality. This tension between what the eye wants and what the hand does is the story of handwriting and fonts. The eye demands that we can read something easily, while the hand wants to add personal style. When these two contrasting ideas work together, the world of typography and calligraphy opens up. Holmes’s comparison captured the main challenge of typography. Follow the rules, but do it expressively and with purpose.\nThis balanced contrast had a huge impact on Steve Jobs. Jobs, known for his design sense, was thoughtfully affected by her tutelage. Jobs said that this class, taken when he was not even a student at Reed, shaped his approach to design. Many years later as he was envisioning the successor to the Apple II, he incorporated advanced computer typography to the interface. The first Macintosh computer included properly spaced fonts and multiple typefaces, which was something completely different from the terminals of the time. Jobs believed that beauty and function should go together, and that computers should have the aesthetic and care found in handwritten letters.\nAn important lessons from her teaching was about the difference between geometric and optical accuracy. Two letters could measure the same size, but they can look different to your eyes. Using a reducing glass, Druckrey would look at student work essentially from far away, spotting visual problems that careful measuring alone couldn’t find. Students learned that our eyes see weight, proportion, and alignment as a whole, not piece by piece. Design is not about mathematical perfection but about visual truth. She taught students to trust their eyes and keep improving their work until it looked right.\nTeaching to See examined the importance of observing carefully, and working patiently to improve. Students were invited into a lifelong practice of noticing the world around them more clearly and more beautifully."

Semantic Accuracy\n\nCheck for mislabeled columns (e.g., latitude/longitude swaps)\nVerify units (e.g., km vs miles, BCE vs CE)\nDecimal vs percentage (e.g., 0.07 vs 7%)\n\n4. Consistency Over Time\n\nHistorical changes tracked (e.g., column schema, CRS, projection systems)\nDecade or time-period tagging consistent (e.g., -90 to -81 BCE)\nAudit trail/logs for any manual cleaning (especially footnote/bibliography removal in PDFs)\n\n5. Missing or Placeholder Data\n\nAll forms of NA/NULL recognized (NA, NaN, null, \"\", -99, etc.)\nMissing values logged by column and count\nDon’t treat 0 as missing unless contextually appropriate\n\n6. Duplicate Detection\n\nCheck for duplicate rows (especially when scraping or merging)\nCheck for near-duplicates (e.g., Roma, Rome, ROME)\nCheck for duplicate IDs (e.g., coin ID, hoard ID, document IDs)\n\n7. Geospatial Sanity\n\nLatitude between -90 and 90; longitude between -180 and 180\nCRS consistent (e.g., EPSG:3035 for European LAEA)\nNo flipped coordinates (common error: lat/lon reversed)\nHoard and mint points lie on land (not sea) if appropriate\n\n8. Textual Consistency\n\nLigatures and hyphens cleaned (e.g., ﬁ → fi, eco-\\nnomic → economic)\nSpellchecked output, especially OCR text\nEntity redactions logged ([REDACTED_PERSON], etc.)\nBibliographic references stripped only after saving original\n\n9. File-Level Integrity\n\nAvoid Excel-specific features (e.g., macros, pivot tables, styles)\nAll outputs saved in open formats (.csv, .txt, .geojson, .rds)\nFolder names consistent and informative (data/raw/, output/cleaned/)\nFile naming conventions follow: source_var_cleaned_YYYYMMDD.csv\n\n10. Reproducibility and Logging\n\nEvery cleaning step is logged (log_cleaning_YYYY-MM-DD.csv)\nEvery script is version-controlled (e.g., Git, Quarto render logs)\nPipeline can skip existing files\nWarnings and anomalies are caught and reported\n\n11. Statistical Sanity Checks\n\nExpected distribution of values? (e.g., coin counts by year)\nLook for spikes and dips (e.g., all hoards dated -87 BCE?)\nCorrelated fields make sense (e.g., coin start ≤ end year)\nGeometric vs optical accuracy assessed for visualizations\n\n12.

Musical notes, which are visual on paper, are based on auditory waveforms over time. Graphics can be processed visually and interpreted nearly instantly as a whole, while music is interpreted sequentially over time to create meaning.\nverbal language\nGraphics communicate through direct visual representation and spatial relationships, showing rather than telling. Verbal language uses symbolic abstraction. Arbitrary words and grammatical structures which require learning conventions to decode meaning. Graphics can transcend spoken language barriers and can often convey complex spatial or quantitative relationships more efficiently than words. Verbal language excels at expressing abstract concepts, logical arguments, and narrative sequences that would be difficult to represent visually in graphics.\nmathematical notations\nBoth graphics and mathematical notation may represent quantitative relationships, but they do so differently. Graphics present information through visual metaphors and relationships suah as showing data through bar heights or trend lines. Mathematical notation uses precise symbolic logic with specific meanings to represent these quantitative relationships. A graph might show that one value is much different than another, while mathematical notation can specify exactly how much different. Graphics also can create a more emotional connnection to the information than mathematics, which is one way that graphics can be more manipulative than mathematics. Mathematical notation is also more compact and precise for complex calculations, while graphics make patterns and relationships more immediately apparent to human visual perception.\n\nHow many ways messages can be conveyed?\nAny way that humans can perceive is a way that we can convey a message. Some are more efficient than others. Some are task-specific. We can categorize these, roughly:\n\nVisual: text, images, graphics, gestures, facial expressions, sign language, light signals\nAuditory: speech, music, sounds, tones\nTactile: touch, braille, vibrations, textures\nOlfactory: scents, pheromones (not a concious choice but worth noting)\nGustatory: taste (very limited uses, though)\n\nDifferent methods of communication serve different purposes, prioritizing different things such as speed, accuracy, distance, etc.\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\nCrawford, Michael H. 1974.

With four datasets, now commonly referred to as the Anscombe Quartet, it is demonstrated that four divergent datasets can have the same statistical properties, but be very different in their structure. The underlying issue was that relying solely on summary data can obfuscate the underlying data features like non-linearity, outliers or other influential points. Anscombe demonstrated the need for residual plots and scatterplots to detect deviations from the underlying model assumptions, such as heteroscedasticity. To address these types of problems, graphic diagnostics should be integrated as a routine component of statistical analysis, especially in a regression or mulivariate analysis."

    "text": "3 Write a critique on a chart in published work (book/article/news website)\n(Hint: Learn from Nathan Yau’s example discussed in class). Post on your website.\n\n\n\nFigure 01\n\n\nCritique of a Graph\nThe chart (Fig 01) shows the cumulative percentage over time (210–30 BCE) across four coin hoards. While it provides a useful comparison of coins over time, it falls short in several ways, and could be made easier to read while being graphically more rich.\nTopic\n\nProblem: The chart does not clearly state what is being accumulated. From the context of the article, it should be apparent, but as a stand alone chart, it is not.\n\nSolution: Add a more precise title and subtitle that clarify the subject of the chart.\n\nProblem: What are the sizes of each hoard. It is not clear how many coins are in each hoard or in each epoch.\n\nSolution: Some method of tracking relative sizes with gradient shading or dot size.\nMessage and Narrative\n\nProblem: The visual comparison between sites is good, but no guidance is provided for interpreting these patterns. For instance, Actium’s rise is extremely late, and HEN shows a sharp increase around 130–100 BCE. These are visually significant but go unmarked.\n\nSolution: Use annotations, callouts, or direct labeling to highlight key inflection points and guide the viewer’s attention to what matters. Tying in historical dates into the timeline will give the reader more connection to the data.\nVisual Encoding and Labeling\n\nProblem: Label is unhelpful and hard to read.\n\nSolution: Move it to the side of the graph, delineate each hoard better, and better show color and shape of each.\n\nProblem: Lines are hard read quickly.\n\nSolution: Change the color palette to something that is easier to read. Vary the line styles. Change the point shape or size.\n\nProblem: The graphs text are hard to read.\n\nSolution: Change font, weight, kerning, or any other parameter to be more legible\nGeography\n\nProblem: Are these hoards located near each other or far? The geographic interrelationship is unknown.\n\nSolution: Add a very tiny map in some of the blank space of the chart. Extend the y-axis if more room is needed.\nAxis and Scale Choices\n\nProblem: Axis labels start with odd numbers. Usually it is quicker and easier to conceptualize dates that start with even numbers.\n\nSolution: Change the labels."

Topic: Arti- ‘fickle’ Intelligence: Using LLMs as a Tool for Inference in the Political and Social Sciences https://utd.link/DAC20251030\n\n\nAttended\n\n\n\n2 Assigned Reading\n\nShinylive\n\nhttps://shinylive.io/r/examples/\n\n\n\nCompleted\n\n\nTime series data\n\nNY: 4; GW: 3, 4 (Optional)\n\n\n\nCompleted\n\n\n\n3 About dependency\n\nWhat is temporal dependency?\n\nTemporal dependency refers to the relationship of data across sequential time increments. Temporal data is often autocorrelated, has sequential patterns, and has lag effects. Because of this, temporal data needs special treatment.\n\nHow about spatial dependency?\n\nSpatial dependency refers to the relationships between different locations. As state by Waldo Tobler, The First Law of Geography is “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” Spatial data often has co-occurrence patterns, autocorrelation, and network effects that must be addressed.\nCombined spatio-semporal data combines all the features of both types of data. Special care needs to be taken to address both issues in these datasets.\n\n\n4 Some time series concepts\n\nARIMA\n\nARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, a family of statistical models used to analyze and forecast time series data by combining:\nAR (AutoRegressive) — uses past values of the series to predict current values. I (Integrated) — uses differencing to make a non-stationary series stationary. MA (Moving Average) — uses past forecast errors to adjust current predictions.\n\nPdq\nThe three model parameters of ARIMA -&gt; ARIMA(p, d, q)\n\n\np (autoregressive order) — how many lagged observations are used (e.g., AR(1) uses 1 lag).\nd (degree of differencing) — how many times the data are differenced to remove trends and achieve stationarity.\nq (moving average order) — how many lagged forecast errors are used in the prediction equation.\n\n\nStationarity\n\nA stationary time series has statistical properties such as mean, variance, etc. that do not change over time. Most time series models require the series to be stationary before fitting.\n\nFirst difference\n\nThe first difference of a time series is the change between consecutive observations. This removes linear trends and makes the series stationary.\n\nFirst order autocorrelation\n\nThe first-order autocorrelation measures how much each observation is related to the immediately before it.\n\n\n5 Charts?\nWhat charts can be used for plotting time? Name three (hint: stock examples).\nFocusing on stock prices, types of charts that are often used include:\n\nSimple Line Chart: This is the simplest time series visualization, which connects data points by lines on a linear time scale. For stocks this is often the closing price. It can show overall trends.\nCandlestick Chart:\n\nThis chart contains more information than the line chart, representing several pieces of information for each time period: open, closing, high and low prices for instance.\n\nOpen-High-Low-Close:\n\nSimilar to candlestick charts but uses vertical lines with horizontal ticks instead of filled/hollow bodies. The left tick shows the opening price, the right tick shows the closing price, and the vertical line spans from the low to the high price. Bonus mentions:\n\nMountain Chart\n\nThis is a variation of the area chart, commonly used in stock charting. The area below the curve is filled to emphasize the volume over time.\n\n\n6 Notes\nAll charts, coding, comments, etc. were enhanced by AI.\n\n\n7 In Class Competition"

    "text": "A designer is trained through repetitive practices and creating multiple works on the same object. This assignment follows that method and requests doing charts via a programming approach. Let’s do a hackathon and generate charts in the next 48 hours.\nRules:\n\nGenerate a program to create a chart using either R Graphics or ggplot2 or any R packages (no other methods/software are allowed)\nAI models are allowed but you need to provide the prompts and detail of AI model (e.g. what model and version).\nCodes and products posted on own GitHub website.\nEmail TA the url of final product within 48 hours (due time at 10 pm, 10/10/2025). Timestamps determine the top three winners. Prizes will be announced in next class. Suggestion: must demonstrate team works instead of individual effort. Members will be randomly selected to answer questions. Pay attention to detail and embellish the chart with design.

That single point forces the slope, giving a misleading regression fit. An example of outlier influence.\n\n\nIV\nNearly all points align vertically at x = 8.

    "text": "3.1 McGhee, Geoff. 2011.\nJournalism in the Age of Data, available at Stanford website.\n\nCompleted\n\n\nWrite a one page review comparing journalistic data visualization and academic data visualization\n\nComparing Journalistic and Academic Data Visualization\nThe landscape of data visualization has expanded rapidly, but two dominant modes—journalistic and academic—illustrate divergent goals, aesthetics, and methodologies. Both serve the essential function of communicating complex data to human audiences, but they differ sharply in how they define success.\nAcademic visualizations emphasize exploration, rigor, and precision. As Martin Wattenberg of IBM notes, visualization is most effective when it’s treated as both art and writing—not just a programming task. In academic contexts, visualizations are often designed to reveal patterns, support hypothesis generation, or offer granular, high-dimensional data explorations, typically for an expert audience. Tools like Many Eyes, Protovis, or Flare reflect this ethos: democratizing access while preserving analytical depth. However, these tools often come with steeper learning curves and require knowledge of statistics, programming, and domain-specific theory. The ideal output here is less about beauty and more about insight, even at the cost of complexity or abstraction.\nJournalistic visualizations, on the other hand, aim to inform, persuade, or emotionally resonate with a general audience. They prioritize narrative clarity, accessibility, and aesthetic engagement. Amanda Cox of The New York Times exemplifies this approach with her “porcupine chart” on federal deficit projections, where visual storytelling clarified complex economic data in seconds. Newsrooms now integrate statisticians, GIS experts, and interface designers, focusing on quick-turnaround visuals that must function under tight editorial deadlines. As noted by Sarah Slobin and others, journalistic visuals must “grab attention within four seconds,” and often adopt slideshow, martini-glass, or drill-down formats to layer depth without overwhelming users.\nYet, challenges remain on both sides. Journalistic visualizations often sacrifice nuance for clarity, potentially leading to shallow or misleading interpretations. Conversely, academic visuals may alienate non-experts by lacking guidance, interactivity, or visual appeal. As Nigel Holmes warns, beautiful but incomprehensible visuals are just as dangerous as poorly written stories.\nThe future likely lies in hybrid approaches. Projects like CrimeSpotting, or the Crisis of Credit video, exemplify a fusion of academic depth and journalistic clarity, blending narrative, interactivity, and motion graphics. As Google’s public data tools and open data initiatives proliferate, both academics and journalists must adapt—reimagining their roles not just as analysts or storytellers, but as designers of discovery experiences.\nIn short, academic visualizations illuminate, journalistic ones communicate. The best visualizations do both."

    "text": "This project was a comprehensive analysis of the spatial distribution of coinage originating from various mints and subsequently deposited in hoards across the Roman world between approximately 500 BCE and 200 CE. By examining patterns in coin dispersal and quantifying the distances between points of minting and findspots, the study aimed to examine the broader dynamics of monetary circulation, and economic integration within the Roman economy. The ultimate objective was to generate insights into the mechanisms of coin movement and to contribute to our understanding of the structure and function of the ancient Roman economic system.\nThe first step that I’d like to look at is the probability of a coin existing in a certain location base on hoard finds.\nNote that there are several errors and mislabeled figures in this. This is for discussion purposes only."

This dataset is based of the work of Crawford (1969), as enhanced by Gruber and Lockyear.\nThis data can be accessed via the website’s APIs or via the SPARQL endpoint at Nomisma. Not all hoards were appropriate for analysis. This initial analysis only included hoard findspots that had the following:\n\nGeolocation of hoard\nAt least 1 coin with a known mint\nKnown mint geolocation\n\nThe findspot information was mostly within a 5 kilometer radius of the findspot. Some was 10 km, but that was less often. For security reasons, the exact geolocation was never directly published to prevent theft and looting.\nFor now, all the findspots meeting the criteria were used, but this may be narrowed in the future."

By analyzing billions of Google search queries, the authors showed that search data possibly could estimate influenza-like illness 1 to 2 weeks earlier than CDC reports.\nThe primary pitfall lay in assuming that correlation is equivalent to causation. Search patterns can shift because of media coverage, public concern, or unrelated events, for example, a drug recall or a news story about influenza may increase search volume even when actual cases do not rise. Such patterns could create false alerts and reduce the reliability of the system. Big data signals are a complementary tool to traditional methods, but not replacements for them.\nOverfitting and Overparameterization\nAnother risk is methodological. The study tested 50 million search queries, ultimately using forty-five that provided the strongest correlation with CDC data. While the results showed a very high correlation, the danger and probability of overfitting remained.\nOverfitting occurs when a model captures patterns that are coincidental rather than meaningful. For example, queries about ‘high school basketball’ correlated with flu season simply because both occur in winter, not because basketball is related to influenza. This illustrated the danger of overparameterization. If too many predictors were considered, strange relationships could appear statistically strong but lack predictive validity in new or different contexts. It is a classic problem in machine learning, where a model could fix the training data extremely well, but fail to have any predicitive power.\nConclusion\nBig data analytics have provided valuable early warning systems, but they require caution. Validation, model simplicity, and domain knowledge are essential to prevent misleading outputs. Analysts must balance any predictive accuracy with interpretability to ensure models remain robust under changing conditions.\n\n\n2 Watch:\n\nHadley Wickham: Data Visualization and Data Science (EMBL)\nName the technologies/techniques Wickham introduced. What are his main points? Summarize and comment.\n\nHadley Wickham: Technologies, Techniques, and Main Ideas\nTechnologies and Techniques Introduced\nIn this talk, Hadley Wickham describes the evolution of his ideas and tools for data visualization and analysis in R. The main technologies and techniques he introduced include:\n\nLattice – an early R package for creating small multiples or repeated visualizations of subsets of data. This experience revealed the limits of static visualization frameworks.\nggplot and ggplot2 – R packages implementing the Grammar of Graphics. These introduced a modular, layered way to construct plots by mapping data variables to visual aesthetics (aes) and choosing geometric objects (geoms).\nTidy Data – a systematic data structure where each variable forms a column and each observation forms a row. This concept ensures data is organized for analysis and visualization.\nThe Tidyverse – a collection of interrelated R packages (such as dplyr, tidyr, readr, ggplot2, purrr, tibble, and others) that share consistent design principles and syntax to support the full data science workflow.\nR Markdown – a framework for combining prose, code, and visualizations into reproducible reports, ensuring that results can be updated automatically when data changes.\nFaceting, Mapping, and Animation – ggplot2 features such as faceting (small multiples) and packages like gganimate that extend visualization to temporal and spatial dimensions.\n\nMain Points\nWickhams talk was broken up into three sections.\nWhat Is a Visualization\nWickham described visualization as a way of thinking about data, not just making pictures.\nVisualization reveals structure, error, and meaning. It is an analytic tool, not purely a decorative addtion.\nUsing Rosling’s Gapminder example, Wickham showed that many visualization challenges are actually data structure problems. Wickham’s solution was ‘tidy data’: each variable in a column and each observation in a row. This consistent format allows data to map cleanly to perception, forming the conceptual foundation for the Grammar of Graphics.\n“The first step, whenever you’re dealing with a data set, is to tidy it up—it will make the rest of your life much easier.”\nThe Power of Orthogonal Components\nWickham builds on the Grammar of Graphics, emphasizing orthogonality, which is the idea that every visualization consists of modular, independent parts such as data, aesthetics, geometries, scales, and facets.\nRather than using chart types, mappings between variables and visual properties are defined. Isolating these components, ggplot2 allows any element to be swapped or recombined. Wickham demonstrated this through successive refinements of the Gapminder plot—adjusting scales, colors, and sizes—and by turning the code into a reusable function.\n\n\n3 The Power of Code\nWickham acknowledged that code can be daunting, but insists code is text, which is readable, shareable, and reproducible. He highlighted three strengths of using code. - Readability: Code can be read like a sentence\n- Reproducibility: Every transformation is explicit and reviewable - Integration: R Markdown merges prose, code, and results in one reproducible document\nThis philosophy underlies the tidyverse which is that tools should make the path of least resistance into the path to good practice. Code is not an obstacle to visualization. It is what makes visualization transparent and sustainable.\nWickham’s ultimate goal is to build a ‘pit of success’, which is a design environment where users naturally fall into effective habits. Visualization provides immediate feedback that motivates learning and connects reasoning to visual evidence.\n\n\n4 Quarto recap:\n\nQuarto Workshop by Tom Mock\n\n\nCompleted\n\nCreate & Publish a Quarto Blog on Quarto Pub in 100 Seconds by Tom Mock\n\nCompleted\n\nQuarto Cheatsheet (bookmark it!)\n\n\n\n\n5 Notes\nCertain elements of this preparation were enhanced with an LLM including code restructuring, commenting, and information layout."

    "text": "Here are some sample plots using the voting data. Any thoughts about what this tells us for analysis?\n\nSetup\nNote the setup variables below. These are supposed to be controls all the plots. Sometimes they are. Sometimes not. Have to clean this up, but the goal is uniformity across all the plots.\nFor fonts, I tried to use ‘sans’ which should pick the system sans serif font for whatever OS is running. In the plotly plot I had to pick a specific font or it defaults to Times New Roman. I picked Arial, but we should look at including Helvetica for macOS users.\n\n# --- Load libraries ---\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggforce)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tigris)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# --- Global color palette (Civic Triangle style) ---\nfill_col   &lt;- \"#ffffff\"   # white background\nline_col   &lt;- \"#3a5f7d\"   # blue-grey for roads and outlines\ntext_col   &lt;- \"#2f3b44\"   # text and titles\nalt_line   &lt;- \"#536cae\"   # secondary line color\nalt_text   &lt;- \"#536cae\"   # secondary text color\nborder_col &lt;- \"#e6eef5\"   # light blue-grey for county borders\n\n# --- Load Texas county-level data ---\nturnout &lt;- read_csv(\"tx_county_voting_data_2020.csv\")\n\n# --- Compute voter turnout rate ---\nturnout &lt;- turnout %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Turnout_Rate = (Total_Votes_Cast / Registered_Voters) * 100\n  )\n\n# --- Map education categories to years of schooling ---\nyears_map &lt;- c(\n  AMRZE002 = 0,  AMRZE003 = 0,  AMRZE004 = 0,\n  AMRZE005 = 1,  AMRZE006 = 2,  AMRZE007 = 3,  AMRZE008 = 4,\n  AMRZE009 = 5,  AMRZE010 = 6,  AMRZE011 = 7,  AMRZE012 = 8,\n  AMRZE013 = 9,  AMRZE014 = 10, AMRZE015 = 11, AMRZE016 = 12,\n  AMRZE017 = 12, AMRZE018 = 12, AMRZE019 = 13, AMRZE020 = 14,\n  AMRZE021 = 14, AMRZE022 = 16, AMRZE023 = 18,\n  AMRZE024 = 19, AMRZE025 = 20\n)\n\nedu_cols &lt;- intersect(names(turnout), names(years_map))\n\n# --- Compute mean years of schooling and normalized education index (0–1) ---\nturnout &lt;- turnout %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    total_edu_pop = rowSums(across(all_of(edu_cols)), na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean_years = rowSums(across(all_of(edu_cols)) *\n                         unname(years_map[edu_cols]), na.rm = TRUE) / total_edu_pop,\n    edu_index = (mean_years - 0) / (20 - 0)\n  )\n\n# --- Create composite Civic variable combining Voting and Education ---\nturnout &lt;- turnout %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Composite civic vitality score\n    vote_edu = (Turnout_Rate/100 + edu_index) / 2\n  )\n\n# --- Preview the first few rows to confirm ---\nhead(turnout)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 34\n  County    COG    Registered_Voters Total_Votes_Cast AMRZE001 AMRZE002 AMRZE003\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Anderson  ETCOG              29274            19227    42328      494        0\n2 Andrews   PBDC               10272             5863    10944      277        0\n3 Angelina  DETCOG             53166            34574    57331     1664       16\n4 Aransas   CCRPC              18306            12290    17811      247        0\n5 Archer    NCTCOG              6538             4796     6192       33        0\n6 Armstrong PHRC                1498             1112     1338       21        4\n# ℹ 27 more variables: AMRZE004 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE005 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE006 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   AMRZE007 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE008 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE009 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE010 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   AMRZE011 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE012 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE013 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE014 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   AMRZE015 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE016 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE017 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE018 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   AMRZE019 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE020 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE021 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE022 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   AMRZE023 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE024 &lt;dbl&gt;, AMRZE025 &lt;dbl&gt;, Turnout_Rate &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   total_edu_pop &lt;dbl&gt;, mean_years &lt;dbl&gt;, edu_index &lt;dbl&gt;, vote_edu &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggforce)\n\n# --- Triangle node coordinates ---\ntriangle &lt;- data.frame(\n  label = c(\"Education\", \"Health\", \"Voter Turnout\"),\n  x = c(0, 1, 0.5),\n  y = c(0, 0, sqrt(3)/2)\n)\n\n# --- Arrows for feedback loops ---\narrows &lt;- data.frame(\n  x = c(0.5, 1, 0),\n  y = c(sqrt(3)/2, 0, 0),\n  xend = c(1, 0, 0.5),\n  yend = c(0, 0, sqrt(3)/2)\n)\n\n# --- Plot ---\np &lt;- ggplot() +\n  # 1.
