    "text": "Background\nMoses Finley’s The Ancient Economy (1973) challenged traditional views of ancient economies, particularly those of Greece and Rome. Finley argued that ancient economies were fundamentally different from modern capitalist systems and should not be analyzed using modern economic concepts.\nSince publication, there have been some shifting thoughts on the inequalities of ancient Rome. This project will be designed to see if there has been a shift in scholarly publications on inequalities in the Roman economic system.\n\n\nHypothesis\n\\[\n\\begin{flalign}\n\\scriptsize\nH_0&: \\scriptsize  \\text{Scholarship about inequality in ancient Rome has not changed.}\\\\\n\\scriptsize\nH_1&: \\scriptsize  \\text{Scholarship has changed.}\n\\end{flalign}\n\\]\n\n\nData Collection\nInitially, data collection will start with gathering access to scholarly journals related to the ancient Roman Empire. We will start with selected articles from JSTOR from publications such as The Journal of Roman Studies.\n\n\nMethods\n\nJournal Acquisition\n\nAcquire a limited dataset of publications\nPreprocess the data including OCR, tokenization, stemming, etc.\n\nConversion\n\nConvert text to numerical representations\n\nModel Selection & Training\nPost-processing\n\n\n\nStart\nThe first step in the process is to verify that the data can actually be collected. Given the size and time constraints, it may be necessary to limit the scope of data collection to a reasonable, but not exhaustive amount.\nThe book The Ancient Economy has been obtained and OCRed.\nOne paper has been downloaded for examination (Brock, Motta, and Terrenato 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\n  A[Start] --&gt; B[Load Text Data]\n  B --&gt; C[Preprocessing]\n  C --&gt;|Convert to Lowercase| C1[Lowercasing]\n  C --&gt;|Remove Punctuation| C2[Remove Punctuation]\n  C --&gt;|Remove Stopwords| C3[Stopword Removal]\n  C --&gt;|Stemming/Lemmatization| C4[Stemming/Lemmatization]\n  C --&gt;|Tokenization| C5[Tokenization]\n  C1 --&gt; D[Create Corpus]\n  C2 --&gt; D\n  C3 --&gt; D\n  C4 --&gt; D\n  C5 --&gt; D\n  D --&gt; E[Feature Extraction]\n  E --&gt;|Bag-of-Words| E1[BoW Model]\n  E --&gt;|TF-IDF| E2[TF-IDF Model]\n  E --&gt;|Word Embeddings| E3[Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe]\n  E1 --&gt; F[Train NLP Model]\n  E2 --&gt; F\n  E3 --&gt; F\n  F --&gt;|Classification| G1[Sentiment Analysis, Spam Detection]\n  F --&gt;|Clustering| G2[Topic Modeling, Named Entity Recognition]\n  F --&gt;|Text Generation| G3[Chatbots, Machine Translation]\n  G1 --&gt; H[Evaluate Model]\n  G2 --&gt; H\n  G3 --&gt; H\n  H --&gt; I[Deploy Model]\n  I --&gt; J[End]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Projects to Consider\nSome other projects that could be considered:\n\nPredictive Modeling of Archaeological Site Locations\nAutomated Artifact Classification and Typology\nTemporal and Spatial Analysis of Settlement Patterns\nText Mining and NLP for Archaeological Literature\nReconstructing Ancient Trade Routes\n\n\n\nBibliography\nBrock, Andrea L., Lorenzo Motta, and Nicola Terrenato. 2021. “On the Banks of the Tiber: Opportunity and Transformation in Early Rome.” The Journal of Roman Studies 111: 1–30. https://www.jstor.org/stable/27128849.\nFinley, Moses I. 1973.

Data mining for the social sciences: An introduction. Univ of California Press. (AM)\n\nReview Chapters 3, 4\n\nCompleted\n\nRead 5, 6\n\nCompleted\n\n\n\nWhat is cross-validation?\n\n\nFrom Gareth et al. in ILSR: Cross-validation “estimate[s] the test error rate by holding out a subset of the training observations from the fitting process, and then applying the statistical learning method to those held out observations.”\n\n\nParaphrased from ChatGPT: Cross-validation is a resampling technique used to evaluate and improve the performance of a model by splitting the data into training and testing sets. This method helps ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and is not overfitting to a single training set.\n\n\nHow to sample big data? Why it is important? What are the difficulties? How to solve this problem?\n\nThere are several ways to sample big data:\n\nRandom: randomly select a sample of the data\nStratified: randomly sample from homogeneous subgroups\nClusters: randomly select clusters and sample all points within\nSystematic: select every k-th element\nReservoir: Keep a fixed-size reservoir, replacing as data streams\nImportance: sample points based on weights\nBernoulli: sample each data point with probability p\nAdaptive: adjust sampling rates based on initial results\nProgressive: Start with a small sample and increase size\nOthers\n\nThese methods are useful because:\n\nEfficiency: Large datasets can be computationally expensive to process.\nSpeed: Larger datasets take longer to process. Smaller datasets can be processed real-time.\nCost: Data storage and compute power cost money. Smaller datasets need less.\nPracticality: We need the processing done in a reasonable amount of time\nFocus: Large datasets can be noisy. A reduced dataset can improve quality.\nScale: Sampling will allow for larger data volumes\nInitial Analysis: Understanding the structure and patterns is easier through sampling\nBias detection: Analyzing differences in sample sets allows for pattern detection\nInference: Proper sampling gives confidence that predictions are accurate\n\nDifficulties (somewhat repetitive):\n\nData Volume: Big data can be very big\nStorage Constraints: Some volume is so large that storing historical data is not possible\nDistribution: Data can be coming from disparate sources that are not co-located\nData distributions imbalance: Some data sets are so large that anomolies may not appear in the sample\nBias: The act of sampling could itself be a bias. For instance active versus inactive users.\nStreaming: real-time data such as media feeds or stock prices have continuous data streams\nCost: The costs for processing the data can be high\nPrivacy and security: personal or sensitive data are a challenge to sample properly\nTime issues: Data may only be valid for a specific time frame\nUnstructured data: Some data may be unstructured such as videos\n\nHow can these problems be mitigated?\n\nData Volume and Storage: use distributed frameworks for parallel processing with compression\nData issues: Choose a proper sampling technique\nDistributed data: set presampled subsets\nBias: use techniques like cross-validation\nReal-time data: use sampling techniques like sliding-window or resevoir sampling\nComputation costs: use approximate query processing and don’t load entire datasets\nPrivacy and security: anonymize the data\nTime-based data: use windowed or adaptive sampling\nBandwidth constraints: process samples before sending data\nUnstructured data: use cluster based sampling or apply pre-training"

Not ideal with this data set.\nJust ignore the missing values in calculations.\n\nReplace Fill in the missing value with a substitute value, such as\n\nFill in with a median value.\nFill in an obvious, but fitting value.\n\n\nIn this case, probably best to ignore the NA in calculations. This is usually with a flag like rm.NA=TRUE or in glm() it is na.action=na.omit or na.action=na.exclude. According to The Companion to Applied Regression: “We encourage the use of na.exclude () for modeling and other functions that work with it.”\n\n\n\n(Next step) Explore the relationship between Tondu and other variables including female, DPP, age, income, edu, Taiwanese and Econ_worse.

Include examples of cutting-edge applications and their implications for the future of Knowledge Mining.”\n\n\n\nSummarize the findings\n\n\n\nThe rapid advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed Knowledge Mining. These technologies have improved our abilities to extract information from large numbers of documents.\nPart of this transformation has been the change from statistical language models (SLMs) to neural language models (NLMs), and more so to pre-trained language models (PLMs). This has improved our abilities to accurately interpret documents. With the subsequent rise of LLMs, such as GPT-series models, there has been a improvement of scaling techniques, significantly expanding model capacities.\nThere are emergent capabilities in LLMs not previously found in other types of models.This has brought about new tools for text processing, including in-context learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning. This has allowed for the models to handle more complex tasks.\nLeveraging these developments are services such as automatic text classification, question-answer systems, etc., which all benefit from the new robust frameworks.\nKnowledge Mining, driven by ongoing research into NLP and LLMs, will develop deeper semantic insights, more accurate extraction techniques, and wider acceptance. Continuous development will be essential to address any limitations.\nA key development has been the dramatic improvement in information extraction capabilities. Modern LLMs can now reasonable identify complex entities, relationships, and context within large corpora, reducing reliance on manual curation, although text extraction from certain document types is still problematic. Enhanced semantic understanding through transformer-based architectures has enabled systems to better capture meanings and intent, finding insights into previously inaccessible data sources.\nLLMs like GPT-4, PaLM 2, and Claude have been instrumental in automating knowledge discovery. These models can synthesize widely varying information, generate human-sounding summaries, and recommend processes, which significantly accelerate workflows in many fields.\nThe impact on data analysis and decision-making is huge. Organizations now deploy knowledge mining software that integrate LLMs to perform tasks like automated document classification, assess risks, and analyze customer feedback. Fine-tuning various models have allowed LLMs to be more transparent and domain-specific.\nLLMs are now working with other smart tools, like knowledge graphs and models that understand pictures and text together. This helps computers organize information in smarter ways, linking facts and ideas. This allows problems to be solved and new ideas developed faster. They are getting better at pulling out important details from books, articles, and other messy text. They can now spot connections between different pieces of information, making research and decision-making much easier.\n\n\n\nIdentify the key concepts\n\n\n\n\n“A Survey of Large Language Models”\n\nEvolution - Models are evolving through research and training.\nEmergence - New abilities are developing based on model size\nScaling - Increasing model size improves existing capabilities\nTraining Techniques - New training techniques and drawing from frameworks improves models\nSpeed - Various methods are being tried to reduce the cost and lower time to build models\n\n“Recent advances in natural language processing via large pre-trained language models: A survey.”\n\nParadigm 1: Pretrain then Fine-Tune Start with a general-purpose model and fine-tune it with task-specific datasets.\nParadigm 2: Prompt-based learning Through instruction-based learning, template-based learning, or proxy-task-base learning to encourage PLMs to perform specific tasks.\nParadigm 3: NLP as text generation This reformulates NLP problems as text-to-text attempting to generate the correct output in a string form that encodes the classification labels or structures.\n\n“A survey on evaluation of large language models.” Evaluation of LLMs is imperative to the development of AI models.

Give specific examples.\n\n\n\nMy project is based on NLP, so that technology and methodology is crucial to the work that I am doing. Where I have used LLMs:\nCode development: It is signficantly faster to request code chunks from an LLM than to write them myself. I can put together code like LEGO bricks, which is significantly faster than writing it cold, myself.\nText cleaning: I have been able to use LLMs very occassionally to strip text from documents to create a corpus.\nArticle summaries: Summarizing articles helps me understand what words in a word cloud might mean. For instance lead the element versus lead the verb.\nResearch: I have used the LLMs instead of search engines to answer questions. They have been faster and more successful that nearly all web-search queries.\n\n\nName limitations and suggest solutions\n\n\nCopyrights: Oddly enough the models that were trained on other peoples work without attribution, seem to reject processing these same works for me. I have tried to use LLMs for text extraction, and I will get either an specific copyright error, or the process will fail without an informative warning. The solution to this is likely to run my own models where I have more control over them.\nDocument Sizes: Most unpaid models have document size limits. This means that I either have to use a paid model or break documents into smaller chunks, losing valuable connections in the process.\nCode problems: Sometimes the code generated is bad or wrong. It may not perform as expected. Thorough review and testing is important.\nHallucinations & Errors: The responses are not perfect, and in some domains, a websearch is still more accurate. These issues are expected to improve over time. Any research should always check the answers to any questions, whether LLMs are used or something else.\n\n\nWrite an AI for research guide (you can use bullet points) incorporating ethnical, technical and acaademic concerns that could lead to more problems than solutions (e.g. Hinton).\n\n\n\nAI Research Guide\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is AI and Why is it Important?\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that enables machines to mimic human thinking, helping automate and simplify complex tasks. It can enhance efficiency, accuracy, and productivity across various areas, including research, but it is not without issues.\n\nPurpose of this Guide\n\nThis guide explains the basic benefits and potential problems of using AI in research. It is designed to help you use AI responsibly and effectively.\nHow AI Helps with Research\n\nWhat AI Can Do\n\nAI analyzes quickly analyzes large sets of data, making it easier for researchers to find patterns and insights. It can also automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.\n\nExamples of AI in Research\n\nAI is used to summarize writing, do predictive analysis, write software and many other useful tasks. Multimedia uses AI include creating podcasts or making images.\nEthical Issues When Using AI\n\nProtect Privacy\n\nAI uses large amounts of data of dubious origin which raises concerns about privacy. The storage and useage of personal information is a very important issue that must be address. Protecting this type of data from misuse is of paramount concern. This requires careful attention to privacy laws, which are very limited in the United States, and adherence to ethical standards.\n\nBe Fair and Unbiased\n\nAI systems include biases from the data they are trained on. If a model is trained on a biased dataset, it too will be biased in the same way. For example, if a model does not know about a new version of a Python package, the code it writes may contain inaccuracies. AIs need to be checked for biases on a regular basis and adjusted to prevent biases.\n\nUnderstand How AI Makes Decisions\n\nTo effectively use AI, it is important to understand how AI arrives at decisions. This transparency to validate the findings is the only way to trust an AI.\nTechnical Problems to Be Careful About\n\nHow Reliable is AI?\n\nAI tools will produce inaccurate results some of the times depending on how the model was trained. All answers, like any good research, should be checked for accuracy.\n\nUsing AI Tools Correctly\n\nProper training to use AI tools is required. An understanding of how to engineer prompts leads to better responses, and conversely poor prompts can lead to misleading results or ineffective research.\n\nTechnology Needs and Sustainability\n\n\nAI uses significant compute power and energy which directly impacts sustainability. Using AI in the future will require considering energy-efficient solutions and how to use optimal technology resources.\n\nAcademic Integrity and AI\n\nPlagiarism\n\nGiven that the sources of the text from AI-generated content are unknown, using AI can inadvertently lead to accusations of plagiarism. Using AI must be properly cited. Always give credit when using AI-generated information.\n\nHonest Research\n\nA researcher’s findings must genuinely reflect their efforts and contributions. Transparency about its use maintains trust.\n\nAI to Helps, Not Replaces, Your Work\n\nThese tools should support your efforts, not replace them. As with using any tool, critical thinking and original insights are crucial to any research.\nRisks and Problems of Using AI\n\nMisuse of AI\n\nPoor or inattentive use of AI may lead to incorrect findings, misinformation, or even ethical violations. Responsible use will prevent this.\n\nLoss of Skills\n\nAn over-reliance on AI may reduce critical thinking and analytical skills, dulling one’s research. Critical analysis remains an important skill.\n\nWho Gets to Use AI?\n\nAs with every technology, access to it is not equal. Given the costs to train and run models, the best models will cost a significant amount of money, thus stratifying access. Without fair and equal access to this technology, much research may not be able to be peer reviewed properly.\nTips for Using Responsibly\n\nBasic Rules, loosely based on Asimov’s Three Laws:\n\nBe transparent and explainable.\nBe aware of bias and discrimination.\nPriorize people and privacy over results.\n\nLearning About AI\n\nKnow your tools and develop a basic understanding of how AI works. Regular training and learning is important.\n\nTransparency, Again\n\nClear citation and documentation of AI processes allows others to evaluate and trust your research.\nThe Future of AI in Research\n\nWhat’s Coming Next\n\nAI will be increasingly integrated into research with new applications and extended capabilities. Continuing education will be crucial.\n\nImportant Discussions About AI\n\nThe ethical, social, and technical implications of the technology will shape all future research practices.\nConclusion\n\nCritical assessment of all AI-generated information, ethical use, and clear documentation of its use in your work are important factors to ensure integrity in you research."

    "text": "Comparison of “To Explain or to Predict?” by Galit Shmueli and “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” by Leo Breiman\n\nBackground\nThe two papers from Breiman and Shmueli are both critiques of traditional modeling approaches. Breiman advocates for shifting from traditional parametric modeling to algorithmic modeling. Schmueli advocates differentiating between explanatory modeling and predictive modeling.\n\n\nBreiman\nThe paper by Breiman (Breiman, 2001) critiques the “data modeling culture” in the field of traditional statistics. He argues that there has been an overreliance on statistical models and interpretability at the expense of algorithmic models, which favor predictability. “Usually, simple parametric models imposed on data generated by complex systems…result in a loss of accuracy and information as compared to algorithmic models.” This has led to models that may not capture real-world data complexities and assume an underlying data generation process that may not exist.\nThrough several examples, he examines the use of traditional modeling as compared to algorithmic modeling. His conclusion is that the “emphasis needs to be on the problem and not the data.”\nAt the end of this paper, there are comments and follow-up by some noted statisticians, which generally agree (except for Cox) with Breiman but bring about some interesting caveats. For instance, Hoadley warns that when creating algorithmic models, care should be taken not to overfit models.\n\n\nShmueli\nThe paper by Shmueli (Shmueli, 2010) looks at the difference between explanatory and predictive modeling, outlining that each supports different goals. Explanatory modeling tests causal hypotheses to describe the underlying mechanisms. Predictive modeling, according to Shmueli, “predictive modeling [is] the process of applying a statistical model or data mining algorithm to data for the purpose of predicting new or future observations.”\nThe paper emphasizes that understanding the difference between the two models is critical to proper model selection during the process. Understanding this difference can impact the study design, data collection, data processing, variable choices, methodologies, and nearly everything else in the modeling process.\nIn the end, it is suggested that it is important to be aware of how models are used and to acknowledge the difference between explanatory, predictive, and descriptive modeling.\n\n\nComparison\nBoth of these papers point out that it is important to distinguish between the different modeling methods while highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each. They also both acknowledge the growing acceptance and usefulness of black-box predictive modeling for data science.\nWhile both support the role of modeling, Breiman advocates primarily for predictive modeling, and Shmueli advocates for making a conscious choice between the two. Shmueli also cautions against assuming that a strong explanatory model means it will have good predictive performance. Breiman states that the historical modeling focus has kept statisticians from effectively modeling real problems.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese papers discuss the evolving landscape of statistical modeling, urging researchers to be more deliberate in their methodological choices and recognize the trade-offs between explanation and prediction. Although both of these papers are decades old, the conclusions remain relevant.\n\n\nBibliography\nBreiman, Leo. 2001. “Statistical modeling: The two cultures (with comments and a rejoinder by the author)”.

Please refer to that for these responses.\n\n\n\nFor the top tags in the document feature matrix, the primary topics other than the participants and their countries were corona virus, and fentanyl.\nLooking at the two feature concurrence matrices,\n\nFCM1\n\n#breaking and #breakingnews co-occur with #biden, #china, and #usa moderately (values between 4 and 5).\n#biden and #china co-occur heavily, particularly #biden + #china = 443 times, and #china + #usa = 76 times, suggesting a strong relationship.\n#pray4america doesn’t seem to co-occur with any other terms.\n#biden and #china seem to be central, with #usa being smaller.\n\nFCM2\n\nThis matrix deals with more specific terms: #joebiden, #xijinping, #america, #americans.\n#biden and #china both strongly co-occur with #joebiden, #xijinping, #america, and #americans. Notably:\n\n#china + #xijinping = 434 times\n#biden + #xijinping = 370 times\n\n#usa and #pray4america have very weak connections in this matrix (almost all zeros or low numbers).\n\n\nLooking at the network plot of the feature concurrence matrix, #fentanyl, #biden / #joebiden, #american(s), #xijinping and # coronavirus are strongly associated.\nFor the FCM of the user DFM, there were few associations between people.\nIn the text plot, there were a couple of echo-chambers worth noticing, but they likely had little or nothing to do with Biden/ Xi.\n\n\n\n\nIn the inaugural speeches, the major features of the speeches centered around government, country, people and similar topics.\nBreaking this down by president, Trump and Obama had more to say about america(n) than Bush and Biden, who more touted freedom and democracy.\n\n\nLooking at the combined lexical dispersion plot for all the presidents, most, except Kennedy peppered their speeches with american and people, but few used trade. It does not appear that there are obvious patterns without further statistical analysis.\nExcept for Bush, presidents mentioned people. There may have been an increase in the use of american with Trump and Biden.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom https://tutorials.quanted.io\n“Wordfish is a Poisson scaling model of one-dimensional document positions (Slapin and Proksch 2008). Wordfish also allows for scaling documents, but in comparison to Wordscores, reference scores/texts are not required. Wordfish is an unsupervised one-dimensional text scaling method, meaning that it estimates the positions of documents solely based on the observed word frequencies.”\nWordfish is an unsupervised scaling method.\n\n\n\n\nStart with an DFM.\nUse Wordfish to model word counts based on:\n\nα (document fixed effect) – controls for length of the document.\n\nβ (word fixed effect) – controls for how common a word.\nθ (document position) – the position of the document on the latent scale (this is what you’re looking for).\nψ (word discrimination parameter) – shows how a word is associated with different positions.\n\n\n\nSo, mathematically: \\[E_{(y_{ij})} = exp(\\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\psi_j * \\theta_i)\\]\n\nOutput:\n\nDocument positions (θ): each document gets a score placing it on the latent scale.\n\nWord weights (ψ): tell you whether a word is more common in in one type or class of texts.\n\n\n\nSome analysis using Wordfish on Quanteda\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(quanteda)\nlibrary(quanteda.textmodels)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n# U.S. inaugural speeches (post-1900)\ndata(\"data_corpus_inaugural\")\ncorpus &lt;- corpus_subset(data_corpus_inaugural, Year &gt;

Please refer to that for these responses.\n\n\n\nFor the top tags in the document feature matrix, the primary topics other than the participants and their countries were corona virus, and fentanyl.\nLooking at the two feature concurrence matrices,\n\nFCM1\n\n#breaking and #breakingnews co-occur with #biden, #china, and #usa moderately (values between 4 and 5).\n#biden and #china co-occur heavily, particularly #biden + #china = 443 times, and #china + #usa = 76 times, suggesting a strong relationship.\n#pray4america doesn’t seem to co-occur with any other terms.\n#biden and #china seem to be central, with #usa being smaller.\n\nFCM2\n\nThis matrix deals with more specific terms: #joebiden, #xijinping, #america, #americans.\n#biden and #china both strongly co-occur with #joebiden, #xijinping, #america, and #americans. Notably:\n\n#china + #xijinping = 434 times\n#biden + #xijinping = 370 times\n\n#usa and #pray4america have very weak connections in this matrix (almost all zeros or low numbers).\n\n\nLooking at the network plot of the feature concurrence matrix, #fentanyl, #biden / #joebiden, #american(s), #xijinping and # coronavirus are strongly associated.\nFor the FCM of the user DFM, there were few associations between people.\nIn the text plot, there were a couple of echo-chambers worth noticing, but they likely had little or nothing to do with Biden/ Xi.\n\n\n\n\nIn the inaugural speeches, the major features of the speeches centered around government, country, people and similar topics.\nBreaking this down by president, Trump and Obama had more to say about america(n) than Bush and Biden, who more touted freedom and democracy.\n\n\nLooking at the combined lexical dispersion plot for all the presidents, most, except Kennedy peppered their speeches with american and people, but few used trade. It does not appear that there are obvious patterns without further statistical analysis.\nExcept for Bush, presidents mentioned people. There may have been an increase in the use of american with Trump and Biden."

    "text": "From https://tutorials.quanted.io\n“Wordfish is a Poisson scaling model of one-dimensional document positions (Slapin and Proksch 2008). Wordfish also allows for scaling documents, but in comparison to Wordscores, reference scores/texts are not required. Wordfish is an unsupervised one-dimensional text scaling method, meaning that it estimates the positions of documents solely based on the observed word frequencies.”\nWordfish is an unsupervised scaling method."

For example, ChatGPT might provide broad coverage, Copilot might excel at concise structuring, and I (Grok 3) might offer a unique perspective on emerging trends.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo length requirement was give for the response, so each of the models must have used an internally defined length limit.\nEach of the models provided a general structure for their responses. ChatGPTs structure was weak and poorly implemented. Copilot was also weak in its structure. It seemed to be a bit more dumbed down than necessary. Meta AI was more professional and better structured. Gemini was produced in an outline form. It seemed more comprehensive than the average response. Llamas response was terse, and not really informative. Similar to Copilot. DeepSeek was also terse and written\nThe focus of this exercise is a literature review, but it seems that these are very poorly structured and written. They are also generally all similar.\nA quick note. The cut and paste responses above do not reflect the output of each of the models. In general, they looked better. DeepSeek output Markdown when copied, which was very good. This had to be changed for the information above because it interfered with the formatting of this quarto document. Gemini had no copy function, requiring output be sent to Google Docs.\n\n\n\nGiven the length of all the responses, they appeared trite. All of the responses, except Llama and Copilot were broken down by groups, such as healthcare. This was not helpful and meant that many areas were not covered.\n\n\n\nThe gap and trend analysis varied widely from model-to-model to the point that a more explicit request needs to be outlined for a new prompt to get the best results.\n\n\n\nAll of the hypotheses that were returned appeared testable, but all were rather specific. All required some domain specific knowledge, and many would have been very expensive to test.\n\n\n\nNot all the references were accurate or complete for any of the models, but the URL links were all live. Copilot only provided links, but no other sources.\n\n\n\n\nTask: Revise the prompt to address deficiencies in each model’s response, creating three tailored prompts—one for ChatGPT, one for Copilot, and one for Grok 3.\nExample Refined Prompt for Grok 3: “Imagine you’re a data scientist conducting a 2,000-word systematic literature review on how data mining and machine learning are applied in domains like healthcare, finance, and education. Outline a clear methodology, synthesize key findings with fresh insights, highlight trends and gaps, and propose one bold, testable hypothesis. Maintain a rigorous academic tone.”\nStudents test these refined prompts and compare the improved outputs.\n\n\nGetting to Grok was incovenient and DeepSeek has provided better responses than most models, so DeepSeek was substituted.\nBelow are the revised prompts for each of the models.\n\n\n\nCreate a 2000 word systematic literature review on the applications of data mining and machine learning. make it like an academic paper\nInclude: Methodology, Trends, Future Outlook, Conclusion and One easily Testable Hypothesis\nRequirements: All statements must be real and true, verified with google scholar A comprehensive list of sources, APSA format and academic tone\n\n\n\nCreate a 2000 word systematic literature review on the applications of data mining and machine learning. make it like an academic paper, less outlined, more rigorous\nInclude: Methodology, Trends, Future Outlook, Conclusion and One easily Testable Hypothesis\nRequirements: All statements must be real and true, verified with google scholar A comprehensive list of sources, APSA format and academic tone\n\n\n\nCreate a 2000 word systematic literature review on the applications of data mining and machine learning. make it like an academic paper, less outlined, more rigorous\nInclude: Methodology, Trends, Future Outlook, Conclusion and One easily Testable Hypothesis\nRequirements: All statements must be real and true, verified with google scholar A comprehensive list of sources, APSA format and academic tone\n\nIn general, the outputs were all improved. Even though the input prompts varied only a little from model-to-model the output was uniformily improved.\n\n\n\nTask: Integrate the best elements from each model’s output into a final systematic review. Write a new prompt for the student’s preferred model (e.g., Grok 3) to synthesize the results.\nExample Synthesis Prompt: “Using these drafts from three AI models [paste outputs], produce a 2,000-word structured systematic literature review on data mining and machine learning applications. Combine the strongest methodology, findings, trends, gaps, and hypothesis into a cohesive, academically sound document.”\nStudents submit their final review and justify their synthesis decisions.\n\n\nI took the output from DeepSeek, ChatGPT and Copilot to create a 2,000 word written report from ChatGPT with the following prompt. ChatGPT was chosen because I have a paid account, and it does not give me busy errors. The actual text input was not included for brevity. The prompt is short but useful.\n\nUsing the included information create a 2000 word written report.\n\nThis is the final output from the prompt above. I have found with the latest models from ChatGPT, simple guidance such as above have produced acceptable outputs. Counterintuitively, more detail has produced stranger results. One thought is that the effort the model puts into following specific request works against the output process.\n\nApplications of Data Mining and Machine Learning: A Systematic Literature Review\nAbstract\nThis systematic literature review explores the applications of data mining and machine learning across multiple domains, including healthcare, finance, education, and cybersecurity. By analyzing current trends and discussing future prospects, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of how these technologies are utilized and where opportunities for further research lie. Additionally, a testable hypothesis is proposed to guide future investigations in this rapidly evolving field.\nIntroduction\nData mining and machine learning (ML) have become indispensable tools in the modern era of big data, driving innovations across diverse fields. These technologies enable the extraction of meaningful patterns from large datasets, facilitating decision-making processes and predictive analytics. As the volume of data generated globally continues to grow exponentially, the applications of data mining and ML have expanded in scope and complexity. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the applications of data mining and ML, focusing on their methodologies, emerging trends, and future directions. The review also identifies gaps in the current research and proposes a testable hypothesis to guide future studies.\nMethodology\nThis review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency. The process involved the following steps:\nData Collection\nA comprehensive search was conducted across several academic databases, including IEEE Xplore, PubMed, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. The search terms included “data mining applications,” “machine learning applications,” “trends in data mining,” “machine learning in healthcare,” and “data mining in finance.” The inclusion criteria were limited to peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2023 that focused on real-world applications of data mining and ML. Articles without empirical evidence, non-English publications, and purely theoretical papers were excluded.\nData Analysis\nThe selected articles were analyzed thematically to identify recurring applications, methodologies, and trends. Quantitative data were extracted and synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of the field. Gap analysis was performed by comparing the stated objectives of the studies with their outcomes, highlighting areas where further research is needed.\nTrends in Data Mining and Machine Learning Applications\nHealthcare\nHealthcare has been one of the most prominent domains for the application of data mining and ML. These technologies have been used for predictive diagnostics, personalized medicine, and patient outcome prediction. For instance, deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to human experts in radiology. Similarly, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been employed to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), enabling the extraction of valuable insights from unstructured text data.\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain. The interpretability of ML models, particularly deep learning, is a significant barrier to their widespread adoption in clinical settings. The “black-box” nature of deep learning models limits their utility in critical applications where transparency is essential.\nFinance\nIn the financial sector, data mining and ML have been widely adopted for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring. Ensemble learning methods, such as XGBoost and Random Forests, have shown superior performance in detecting fraudulent transactions compared to traditional statistical methods. These methods have reduced false positives significantly, improving the efficiency of fraud detection systems.\nHowever, the financial domain also faces challenges related to data quality and scalability. Noisy and incomplete datasets can hinder the performance of ML models, while the increasing volume of financial data necessitates the development of scalable algorithms.\nEducation\nEducational institutions have increasingly turned to data mining and ML to enhance learning outcomes and operational efficiency. Applications include learning analytics, student performance prediction, and adaptive learning systems. Clustering algorithms, such as K-means, have been used to segment students based on their learning behaviors, enabling targeted interventions.\nDespite these successes, the field of educational data mining faces challenges related to data privacy and ethical considerations. The use of student data for predictive analytics raises concerns about consent and the potential for bias in algorithmic decision-making.\nCybersecurity\nCybersecurity is another domain where data mining and ML have made significant contributions. These technologies have been used for intrusion detection, malware classification, and anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning techniques, such as autoencoders, have shown promise in identifying novel attack patterns that traditional rule-based systems might miss.\nHowever, the adversarial nature of cybersecurity presents unique challenges. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in ML models, leading to adversarial attacks that compromise system integrity. As a result, there is a growing need for robust and resilient ML systems in cybersecurity.\nFuture Outlook\nThe future of data mining and ML is shaped by several emerging trends and technologies. Explainable AI (XAI) is gaining traction as a means to address the interpretability challenges associated with deep learning models. XAI techniques aim to provide transparent and understandable explanations for model predictions, enhancing trust and adoption in critical applications.\nFederated learning is another promising area of research. This approach enables decentralized model training, allowing multiple parties to collaborate without sharing raw data. Federated learning has the potential to address data privacy concerns, particularly in domains such as healthcare and finance.\nQuantum machine learning is also on the horizon, leveraging the computational power of quantum computers to solve complex optimization problems. While still in its infancy, quantum machine learning holds the potential to revolutionize fields such as drug discovery and financial modeling.\nConclusion\nThis systematic literature review highlights the transformative impact of data mining and ML across various domains. While these technologies have enabled significant advancements, challenges related to interpretability, data quality, and scalability remain. Future research should focus on developing robust, scalable, and interpretable models to address these challenges. Additionally, ethical considerations, particularly in domains such as education and healthcare, must be carefully addressed to ensure the responsible use of data mining and ML.\nTestable Hypothesis\nOne easily testable hypothesis emerging from this review is:\n“Ensemble learning methods, such as XGBoost and Random Forests, will outperform traditional statistical methods in fraud detection tasks, achieving at least a 20% reduction in false positives.”\nThis hypothesis can be tested by comparing the performance of ensemble learning methods with traditional statistical methods on a standardized fraud detection dataset, such as the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset available on Kaggle.\nReferences\nChandola, V., Banerjee, A., & Kumar, V.

ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 10(2), 1-19.\n\n\n\nTask: Write a reflection answering:\n\nHow did each model approach the systematic review differently?\nWhich prompt refinements yielded the best results for each model?\nWhat did you learn about leveraging AI for structured academic reviews?\n\n\n\nThe response from each model was slightly different. It seems that each model has set different priorities on the types of responses included. Some of the responses are more structured and less written. Some the opposite.\nChatGPT: Perhaps a bit too structured when structure was requested. This might be great for outlining for a paper. The refinements required to remove the request for structure.\nCopilot seemed a bit dumbed-down. Although it included many words, it did not include much content. This required pushing the model for details.\nDeepSeek: This was my favorite model for this exercise. It had a good balance between structure and content. Model refinements were needed to get additional details. This model also seemed to produce valid sources.\nFor structured academic reviews, like most things, good, targeted questions lead to the best answers."

By analyzing current trends and discussing future prospects, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of how these technologies are utilized and where opportunities for further research lie. Additionally, a testable hypothesis is proposed to guide future investigations in this rapidly evolving field.\nIntroduction\nData mining and machine learning (ML) have become indispensable tools in the modern era of big data, driving innovations across diverse fields. These technologies enable the extraction of meaningful patterns from large datasets, facilitating decision-making processes and predictive analytics. As the volume of data generated globally continues to grow exponentially, the applications of data mining and ML have expanded in scope and complexity. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the applications of data mining and ML, focusing on their methodologies, emerging trends, and future directions. The review also identifies gaps in the current research and proposes a testable hypothesis to guide future studies.\nMethodology\nThis review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency. The process involved the following steps:\nData Collection\nA comprehensive search was conducted across several academic databases, including IEEE Xplore, PubMed, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. The search terms included “data mining applications,” “machine learning applications,” “trends in data mining,” “machine learning in healthcare,” and “data mining in finance.” The inclusion criteria were limited to peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2023 that focused on real-world applications of data mining and ML. Articles without empirical evidence, non-English publications, and purely theoretical papers were excluded.\nData Analysis\nThe selected articles were analyzed thematically to identify recurring applications, methodologies, and trends. Quantitative data were extracted and synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of the field. Gap analysis was performed by comparing the stated objectives of the studies with their outcomes, highlighting areas where further research is needed.\nTrends in Data Mining and Machine Learning Applications\nHealthcare\nHealthcare has been one of the most prominent domains for the application of data mining and ML. These technologies have been used for predictive diagnostics, personalized medicine, and patient outcome prediction. For instance, deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to human experts in radiology. Similarly, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been employed to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), enabling the extraction of valuable insights from unstructured text data.\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain. The interpretability of ML models, particularly deep learning, is a significant barrier to their widespread adoption in clinical settings. The “black-box” nature of deep learning models limits their utility in critical applications where transparency is essential.\nFinance\nIn the financial sector, data mining and ML have been widely adopted for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring. Ensemble learning methods, such as XGBoost and Random Forests, have shown superior performance in detecting fraudulent transactions compared to traditional statistical methods. These methods have reduced false positives significantly, improving the efficiency of fraud detection systems.\nHowever, the financial domain also faces challenges related to data quality and scalability. Noisy and incomplete datasets can hinder the performance of ML models, while the increasing volume of financial data necessitates the development of scalable algorithms.\nEducation\nEducational institutions have increasingly turned to data mining and ML to enhance learning outcomes and operational efficiency. Applications include learning analytics, student performance prediction, and adaptive learning systems. Clustering algorithms, such as K-means, have been used to segment students based on their learning behaviors, enabling targeted interventions.\nDespite these successes, the field of educational data mining faces challenges related to data privacy and ethical considerations. The use of student data for predictive analytics raises concerns about consent and the potential for bias in algorithmic decision-making.\nCybersecurity\nCybersecurity is another domain where data mining and ML have made significant contributions. These technologies have been used for intrusion detection, malware classification, and anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning techniques, such as autoencoders, have shown promise in identifying novel attack patterns that traditional rule-based systems might miss.\nHowever, the adversarial nature of cybersecurity presents unique challenges. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in ML models, leading to adversarial attacks that compromise system integrity. As a result, there is a growing need for robust and resilient ML systems in cybersecurity.\nFuture Outlook\nThe future of data mining and ML is shaped by several emerging trends and technologies. Explainable AI (XAI) is gaining traction as a means to address the interpretability challenges associated with deep learning models. XAI techniques aim to provide transparent and understandable explanations for model predictions, enhancing trust and adoption in critical applications.\nFederated learning is another promising area of research. This approach enables decentralized model training, allowing multiple parties to collaborate without sharing raw data. Federated learning has the potential to address data privacy concerns, particularly in domains such as healthcare and finance.\nQuantum machine learning is also on the horizon, leveraging the computational power of quantum computers to solve complex optimization problems. While still in its infancy, quantum machine learning holds the potential to revolutionize fields such as drug discovery and financial modeling.\nConclusion\nThis systematic literature review highlights the transformative impact of data mining and ML across various domains. While these technologies have enabled significant advancements, challenges related to interpretability, data quality, and scalability remain. Future research should focus on developing robust, scalable, and interpretable models to address these challenges. Additionally, ethical considerations, particularly in domains such as education and healthcare, must be carefully addressed to ensure the responsible use of data mining and ML.\nTestable Hypothesis\nOne easily testable hypothesis emerging from this review is:\n“Ensemble learning methods, such as XGBoost and Random Forests, will outperform traditional statistical methods in fraud detection tasks, achieving at least a 20% reduction in false positives.”\nThis hypothesis can be tested by comparing the performance of ensemble learning methods with traditional statistical methods on a standardized fraud detection dataset, such as the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset available on Kaggle.\nReferences\nChandola, V., Banerjee, A., & Kumar, V.

It seems that each model has set different priorities on the types of responses included. Some of the responses are more structured and less written. Some the opposite.\nChatGPT: Perhaps a bit too structured when structure was requested. This might be great for outlining for a paper. The refinements required to remove the request for structure.\nCopilot seemed a bit dumbed-down. Although it included many words, it did not include much content. This required pushing the model for details.\nDeepSeek: This was my favorite model for this exercise. It had a good balance between structure and content. Model refinements were needed to get additional details. This model also seemed to produce valid sources.\nFor structured academic reviews, like most things, good, targeted questions lead to the best answers."

By analyzing current trends and discussing future prospects, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of how these technologies are utilized and where opportunities for further research lie. Additionally, a testable hypothesis is proposed to guide future investigations in this rapidly evolving field.\nIntroduction\nData mining and machine learning (ML) have become indispensable tools in the modern era of big data, driving innovations across diverse fields. These technologies enable the extraction of meaningful patterns from large datasets, facilitating decision-making processes and predictive analytics. As the volume of data generated globally continues to grow exponentially, the applications of data mining and ML have expanded in scope and complexity. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the applications of data mining and ML, focusing on their methodologies, emerging trends, and future directions. The review also identifies gaps in the current research and proposes a testable hypothesis to guide future studies.\nMethodology\nThis review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency. The process involved the following steps:\nData Collection\nA comprehensive search was conducted across several academic databases, including IEEE Xplore, PubMed, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. The search terms included “data mining applications,” “machine learning applications,” “trends in data mining,” “machine learning in healthcare,” and “data mining in finance.” The inclusion criteria were limited to peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2023 that focused on real-world applications of data mining and ML. Articles without empirical evidence, non-English publications, and purely theoretical papers were excluded.\nData Analysis\nThe selected articles were analyzed thematically to identify recurring applications, methodologies, and trends. Quantitative data were extracted and synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of the field. Gap analysis was performed by comparing the stated objectives of the studies with their outcomes, highlighting areas where further research is needed.\nTrends in Data Mining and Machine Learning Applications\nHealthcare\nHealthcare has been one of the most prominent domains for the application of data mining and ML. These technologies have been used for predictive diagnostics, personalized medicine, and patient outcome prediction. For instance, deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to human experts in radiology. Similarly, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been employed to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), enabling the extraction of valuable insights from unstructured text data.\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain. The interpretability of ML models, particularly deep learning, is a significant barrier to their widespread adoption in clinical settings. The “black-box” nature of deep learning models limits their utility in critical applications where transparency is essential.\nFinance\nIn the financial sector, data mining and ML have been widely adopted for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring. Ensemble learning methods, such as XGBoost and Random Forests, have shown superior performance in detecting fraudulent transactions compared to traditional statistical methods. These methods have reduced false positives significantly, improving the efficiency of fraud detection systems.\nHowever, the financial domain also faces challenges related to data quality and scalability. Noisy and incomplete datasets can hinder the performance of ML models, while the increasing volume of financial data necessitates the development of scalable algorithms.\nEducation\nEducational institutions have increasingly turned to data mining and ML to enhance learning outcomes and operational efficiency. Applications include learning analytics, student performance prediction, and adaptive learning systems. Clustering algorithms, such as K-means, have been used to segment students based on their learning behaviors, enabling targeted interventions.\nDespite these successes, the field of educational data mining faces challenges related to data privacy and ethical considerations. The use of student data for predictive analytics raises concerns about consent and the potential for bias in algorithmic decision-making.\nCybersecurity\nCybersecurity is another domain where data mining and ML have made significant contributions. These technologies have been used for intrusion detection, malware classification, and anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning techniques, such as autoencoders, have shown promise in identifying novel attack patterns that traditional rule-based systems might miss.\nHowever, the adversarial nature of cybersecurity presents unique challenges. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in ML models, leading to adversarial attacks that compromise system integrity. As a result, there is a growing need for robust and resilient ML systems in cybersecurity.\nFuture Outlook\nThe future of data mining and ML is shaped by several emerging trends and technologies. Explainable AI (XAI) is gaining traction as a means to address the interpretability challenges associated with deep learning models. XAI techniques aim to provide transparent and understandable explanations for model predictions, enhancing trust and adoption in critical applications.\nFederated learning is another promising area of research. This approach enables decentralized model training, allowing multiple parties to collaborate without sharing raw data. Federated learning has the potential to address data privacy concerns, particularly in domains such as healthcare and finance.\nQuantum machine learning is also on the horizon, leveraging the computational power of quantum computers to solve complex optimization problems. While still in its infancy, quantum machine learning holds the potential to revolutionize fields such as drug discovery and financial modeling.\nConclusion\nThis systematic literature review highlights the transformative impact of data mining and ML across various domains. While these technologies have enabled significant advancements, challenges related to interpretability, data quality, and scalability remain. Future research should focus on developing robust, scalable, and interpretable models to address these challenges. Additionally, ethical considerations, particularly in domains such as education and healthcare, must be carefully addressed to ensure the responsible use of data mining and ML.\nTestable Hypothesis\nOne easily testable hypothesis emerging from this review is:\n“Ensemble learning methods, such as XGBoost and Random Forests, will outperform traditional statistical methods in fraud detection tasks, achieving at least a 20% reduction in false positives.”\nThis hypothesis can be tested by comparing the performance of ensemble learning methods with traditional statistical methods on a standardized fraud detection dataset, such as the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset available on Kaggle.\nReferences\nChandola, V., Banerjee, A., & Kumar, V. (2018). Anomaly detection: A survey. ACM Computing Surveys, 41(3), 1-58.\nDal Pozzolo, A., Caelen, O., Le Borgne, Y. A., Waterschoot, S., & Bontempi, G. (2015).

    "text": "The book, The Ancient Economy by Moses Finley (1973) challenged assumptions about economic freedom in the ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Social status, political structures, and ideological norms were greater forces than market forces, according to Finley. This project will look at the literature decade-by-decade to see if and how language about economics changed over time. Introduction\nMoses Finley (1973) challenged assumptions about economic freedom in the ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Social status, political structures, and ideological norms were greater forces than market forces. Unlike our contemporary capitalist economies, where individual economic decisions at various levels is central, the Greco-Roman world operated under hierarchies that limited economic freedom to the privileged few.\nSlavery formed the backbone of production leaving these laborers no control over their economic lives. Even free citizens faced restrictions such as lack of political privilege, land ownership issues, and state interventions in areas such as price control. Finley described the elite’s disdain for commerce and manual labor, reinforcing a preference for land-based wealth over market participation.\nIn his arguments, he emphasized the dominance of household economies, where self-sufficiency was prioritized over trade. Finley relied on the supposition that economic decisions were driven more by status, honor, and political power than by rational market incentives. He held that modern economic theories cannot or should not be applied to ancient societies, since the deeply embedded social structures constrained economic freedom.\nWhile this was a seminal writing on ancient economies, subsequent researchers have pushed back on his assertions. For instance Kevin Green (Green 2000) argues that Finley underestimated the impact that technology had by stating: “The principal conclusion is that Finley underestimated the spread of technological improvements, especially under the Romans.” An example of this is Roman grain production: “However, we now know that mechanical grain-mills driven by muscle power or water were common on Roman estates, in towns, and in military contexts throughout the empire.” These general sentiments have been echoed by other scholars.\nThis project’s primary purpose is to develop a workflow to use current tools to examine contemporary documents. It is not to prove or disprove any single theory, but rather to examine the change, if any, of sentiment over time in the scholarship regarding the circumstances of economic activities in the ancient world.\n\n\n\nFor this project, the initial literature search has shown no similar analysis of modern interpretations of the ancient world; however, this could change in the future. There are many instances of NLP being applied to surviving texts in ancient languages, as well as applications to things like social media streams, books, poetry, etc.\nValdez (2020) applied NLP techniques to ADHD on PubMed over time, investigating the change in words, which is similar to this undertaking. Underwood (2012) has provided a quick explainer on Topic Modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in this analysis is to develop a body of works. Initial efforts, including working with the McDermott Library staff have indicated that developing a citation list of articles will be difficult. Developing a citation list for books might not be possible. Downloading articles will have to be one-at-a-time. Books may or may not be possible. Given the time constraints, we are expecting this to be a proof-of-concept with best-efforts for data. If the work is expanded, this will have to be re-examined.\n\n\n\nThere are several tools that we expect to look at to find the best fit with the analysis. Initially, without examining the data, it seems that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is the first choice to analyze the data, with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) the next choice. Two newer methods, Top2Vec and BERTopic are available, but only in Python. Since this project is more proof-of-concept, and work has already started in R, this will likely have to wait unless there is some necessitating tragedy.\nThe current toolchain that is being built relies on TidyR text processing. If any other processes are required, they will be incorporated.\n\n\n\n\nFor this proposal, a text-based analysis will be performed on a corpus of works, which have been segmented into decades. This corpus will be as large as feasible given the allotted time.\n\n\n\nFinley, Moses I. 1973. The Ancient Economy.
